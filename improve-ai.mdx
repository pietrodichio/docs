Remember that once you download our Shopify App the AI Assistant will have access to the following information about your store: product catalogs, product pages, product photos, product variants, prices, product descriptions, product URLs.

To further improve the quality of the responses provided by the AI you can do the following 2 things:

- Provide RULES to the AI Assistant.
- Insert as many Q&As as possible.

## Rules Section

In the ‘Rules’ section imagine that you are giving instructions to a human being: be as concise and clear as possible.

This is the section you will have to tell the AI Assistant how to behave or how to respond in specific situations.

Some examples of rules that you can add:

1. Be sure to always answer succinctly and concisely.
2. Continuously gather feedback from customers to improve products or services.
3. If a customer asks to speak with a real person, tell them to contact customer support at the following email address [youremail.com]
4. If a customer has a problem with an order, suggest they contact customer support at the following email address [youremail.com].

<Warning>
  **IMPORTANT:** add rules only if you feel they are critical to improving
  interaction with the end customer.
</Warning>

## Q&A Section

Think about the most common questions your customers ask you and include all of them, with the respective answers you would like the AI to provide, in the Q&A section.

Some examples of Q&As that you can add:

1. Do you have any discounts?
2. What payment methods do you accept?
3. Can I pay by cash on delivery?
4. How do I make a return?
5. What are the shipping times?
6. Is shipping free of charge?
7. What is the expiration date of your products?
8. I would like a guide to your sizes, where can I find them?
