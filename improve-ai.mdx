To improve the quality of the responses provided by the AI you can do the following 2 things:

- Provide textual instructions to the AI Shopping-Assistant.
- Insert as many Q&As as possible.

In the ‘Instructions’ section imagine that you are giving instructions to a human being: be as concise and clear as possible. Include rules only if you believe the information you wish to share is not present within the pages of your website.

Some examples of rules that you can add:

1. If a customer asks to speak with a real person, tell them to contact customer support at the following email address _[youremail.com]_
2. If a customer has a problem with an order, suggest they contact customer support at the following email address _[youremail.com]_.
3. If a customer asks if there are any active discounts, suggest they use the **_WHATSAPP15_** coupon (must be entered at checkout) to get a 15% discount on their next order.

Make sure that the last part of the text in the 'Instructions' section is where you tell the AI Shopping-Assistant his role and characteristics (e.g. You are a Customer Manager of [brand]. Your mission is to etc).

Think about the most common questions your customers ask you and include all of them, with the respective answers you would like the AI to provide, in the Q&A section.
