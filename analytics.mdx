## Order attribution

The orders you see on the 'Analytics' page are only attributed if a customer places an order within a **48h time** window after activating a conversation.

If a customer first places an order and later activates a conversation, that order is **NOT** attributed to TextYess.

## How we calculate ROAS

The ROAS you see in the [Analytics](https://ai.textyess.com/analytics) section is calculated by considering the cost you are paying on a monthly basis or on what is the period you want to view.

**Example:** let's imagine that the monthly cost you are paying to use TextYess is 99€, you want to calculate the ROAS in the last 7 days, it means that the cost of the tool was 24.75€, if you had 500€ of revenue, it means that your ROAS in those 7 days will be 20 (500/24.75).
