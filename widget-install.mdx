description: "Once you have integrated WhatsApp with TextYess you will need to allow your customers to interact with your AI Shopping-Assistant. For this we provide a widget to install on your store."
---

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customize your widget appearance">
    Click on the "Integrations" section of the menu. From there select the Chat Bubble integration block and personalize your widget.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get the code snippet">
    From there you will find the code snippet to insert into your Shopify theme. <br /> 
    The code will look something like this:

```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://cdn.textyess.com/v1/textyess-widget-components/textyess-widget-components.esm.js"
  defer
/>
<textyess-bubble-widget user_id="your_user_id" />
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to the Online store section">
    Once inside your store click on "Sales channels" from the menu on the right. <br/>

    A pop-up will appear at the top. From there click on "Online store"

     <Frame>
        <img src="/images/first_step.png" />
    </Frame>

    



  </Step>
  <Step title="WhatsApp business account creation">
    Once you verify your email and confirm that you have all the requirements
    (see the What do you need section) a new pop-up will be created. This pop-up
    is owned by Meta. <br /> <br />
    At this stage what you will need to do is select the Meta Business Account you
    would like to use. <br /> <br />
    From there you will need to select or create a WhatsApp Business Account and
    a related WhatsApp Business Profile. <br /> <br />
        <Tip> We strongly suggest creating both from scratch and not using existing resources to
    avoid any conflicts.</Tip>
     The last step will be to enter the phone number
    you want to use and verify it by call or SMS.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize TextYess">
    Finished with Meta you will return to the 360dialog pop-up. There you must
    select the phone number you just connected and approve the connection to
    TextYess. <br /> <br /> This process may take a few minutes so we recommend
    that you leave the window open until you are redirected to TextYess. <br />
     <br />
