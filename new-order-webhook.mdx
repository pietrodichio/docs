## Overview

The New Order Webhook allows your application to receive real-time notifications when a new order is created in the system. This webhook sends detailed information about the order, including customer details, line items, and financial status.

## Webhook Endpoint

The webhook endpoint for new orders is:
POST /webhooks/new-order/:id

Where `:id` is the unique identifier for the user or merchant account.

## Payload Structure

The webhook sends a JSON payload with the following structure:

<CodeGroup>
typescript NewOrderDto
export class NewOrderDto {
id: string;
shipping_address?: AddressDto;
billing_address?: AddressDto;
created_at: string;
email?: string;
customer?: CustomerDto;
order_number?: number;
total_price: string;
payment_gateway_names: string[];
line_items: LineItemDto[];
financial_status: FinancialStatus;
phone: string;
fulfillments?: FulfillmentDto[];
order_status_url?: string;
}
</CodeGroup>

### Key Components

- `id`: Unique identifier for the order (string)
- `shipping_address` and `billing_address`: Customer address information
- `customer`: Details about the customer who placed the order
- `line_items`: Array of products in the order
- `financial_status`: Current payment status of the order (enum)
- `fulfillments`: Shipping and tracking information, if available

## Example Payload

Here's an example of a typical payload sent by the New Order Webhook:

"customer": {
"id": "cust_123456",
"first_name": "John",
"last_name": "Doe",
"phone": "+1234567890"
},
"order_number": 1001,
"total_price": "99.99",
"payment_gateway_names": ["stripe"],
"line_items": [
{

}
],

"shipping_address": {
"first_name": "John",
"last_name": "Doe",
"address1": "123 Main St",

"zip": "12345",
"country": "United States",
"country_code": "US"
},
"order_status_url": "https://example.com/order/status/1234567890"
}

## Handling the Webhook

To process the incoming webhook:

1. Verify the authenticity of the webhook (implement your own security measures).
2. Parse the JSON payload into your `NewOrderDto` object.
3. Process the order information as needed for your application.
4. Respond with a 200 OK status to acknowledge receipt of the webhook.

<Warning>
  Always validate and sanitize incoming webhook data before processing it in
  your application.
</Warning>

## Testing

To test your webhook integration:

1. Set up a webhook endpoint in your development environment.
2. Use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to simulate webhook calls.
3. Send test payloads to your endpoint and verify that your application handles them correctly.

<Note>
  Remember to update your webhook URL in the production environment once you've
  completed testing.
