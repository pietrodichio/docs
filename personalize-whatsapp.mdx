To update your WhatsApp profile photo or status, visit https://ai.textyess.com/profile/whatsapp.

For the profile picture, upload a **500x500** company logo. If you do not know how to reset the logo size, use [Canva](https://canva.com/), create a new design (500x500), and insert your logo there.

For the status, consider using: _"Hi! I'm the virtual assistant for [brand]. How can I help you?"_.
