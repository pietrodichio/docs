```

  type="string"
  required

  Comma-separated list of product IDs to delete. For example: `ids=prod_12345,prod_67890,prod_11111`
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean">
  Indicates if the deletion was successful

## Rate Limiting

The bulk delete endpoint is limited to 200 products per request to ensure optimal performance.

## Best Practices

1. **Validation**: Verify product IDs exist before attempting deletion.
2. **Batch Size**: Keep batches under 200 products to avoid rate limits.
3. **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for rate limit errors.
4. **Backup**: Consider backing up product data before bulk deletion.
5. **Idempotency**: The operation is idempotent - attempting to delete the same products multiple times won't cause issues.
