## Install the app

The first step to start using TextYess is to [install our Shopify App](https://apps.shopify.com/textyess-1). This will allow us to start training our artificial intelligence.

## Make it yours

The next steps are based on giving you the ability to customize your AI-Shopping Assisant.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customize your instructions">
    Setting the right instructions for your AI Shopping-Assistant is critical to
    successful use of TextYess. Give your shopping assistant a name and tone of
    voice, and set other instructions to explain how you want it to respond.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert your FAQs">
    What are the most frequently asked questions by your customers? Try to
    answer them thoroughly so you don't have to worry about it anymore and let
    the shopping assistant do all the dirty work.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test your AI Shopping-Assistant">
    Now is the time to have fun! Now that you have provided all the necessary
    information your AI Shopping-Assistant is ready to be tested. You can ask as
    many questions as you want but remember: if you are not satisfied with the
    answers you can always go back and improve the instructions or FAQs you set
    up earlier.
