```bash
x-auth-token: your_jwt_token
```

## Body Parameters

## Rate Limiting

The bulk import endpoint is limited to 1000 products per file to ensure optimal performance.

## Best Practices

1. **File Hosting**: Ensure your JSONL file is hosted on a reliable, publicly accessible URL.
2. **File Size**: Keep your JSONL file under 10MB for optimal processing.
3. **Data Validation**: Validate your JSONL structure before uploading to avoid failed imports.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for rate limit errors.
5. **Idempotency**: The operation is idempotent - uploading the same file multiple times won't create duplicate products.
