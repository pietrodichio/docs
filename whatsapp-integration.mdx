title: "WhatsApp Integration"
description: "Integrating WhatsApp is a very delicate process. This is because Meta, the company behind WhatsApp, is particularly keen on having virtuous companies use its services. Therefore, we ask you to read this guide carefully so that you can avoid any hiccups."

### Our partner

In order to make this phase as easy as possible, we relied on a partner, 360dialog. But don't worry, you won't have to do anything on their platform.

## What do you need

### Valid email address

The first step of the WhatsApp integration is to create a 360dialog account.
This should be created under a valid email address (free email domains are not allowed).
This email address should also not be registered under any other 360dialog accounts.

### Meta Business Manager Account with complete Business Info

Having a Meta Business Manager Account and having access to that account is critical to succeeding in the next steps.
Also, having an already verified account allows for a whole range of advantages in the integration process.

### Phone number

The number must be able to receive an International Phone Call or SMS during the registration process and be owned by the client.

<Warning>
  **Important:** the number to be used must not be currently in use for WhatsApp
  on a phone or through other tools.
</Warning>

### WhatsApp Business Compliance

Your business must not violate or have violated [WhatsApp's Business Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-policy/) and [Commercial Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/policies/commerce-policy/).

## Step by step WhatsApp integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the integration">
    Click on the "Integrations" section of the menu. From there click on the
    "Connect WhatsApp" button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the free trial">
    If you have not already done so, you will be asked to select a plan to start
    the free trial.y about it anymore and let the shopping assistant do all the
    dirty work.
  </Step>
  <Step title="360dialog account creation">
    Once you run the free trial you can start the actual integration by clicking
    on the Connect WhatsApp button again. This will bring up a popup asking you
    to create a 360dialog account. You will be able to create an account through
    email or through Facebook. 
    
     <Tip>  We recommend using email creation and especially
    recommend using an email with which you are sure you do not already have a
    360dialog account.</Tip>
    
   
  </Step>
  <Step title="WhatsApp business account creation">
    Once you verify your email and confirm that you have all the requirements
    (see the What do you need section) a new pop-up will be created. This pop-up
    is owned by Meta. <br /> <br />
    At this stage what you will need to do is select the Meta Business Account you
    would like to use. <br /> <br />
    From there you will need to select or create a WhatsApp Business Account and
    a related WhatsApp Business Profile. <br /> <br />
        <Tip> We strongly suggest creating both from scratch and not using existing resources to
    avoid any conflicts.</Tip>
     The last step will be to enter the phone number
    you want to use and verify it by call or SMS.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize TextYess">
    Finished with Meta you will return to the 360dialog pop-up. There you must
    select the phone number you just connected and approve the connection to
    TextYess. <br /> <br /> This process may take a few minutes so we recommend
    that you leave the window open until you are redirected to TextYess. <br />
